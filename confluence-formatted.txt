h1. AWS Control Tower Config Customization Solution

h2. Executive Summary

The AWS Control Tower Config Customization solution provides an automated approach to exclude specific AWS resource types from AWS Config recording across all Control Tower managed accounts. This implementation specifically excludes EC2 Fleet and EC2 Spot Fleet resources, which are commonly used for dynamic compute workloads and can generate excessive Config recording costs without providing significant compliance value.

h3. Key Benefits
* *Cost Optimization*: Reduces AWS Config costs by excluding high-volume, transient resources
* *Automated Management*: Applies exclusions automatically to all existing and new Control Tower accounts
* *Compliance Maintained*: Preserves Control Tower baseline compliance while customizing Config recording
* *Scalable Solution*: Works seamlessly as new accounts are added to the organization

h2. Architecture Overview

h3. Solution Components

The solution implements a Producer-Consumer Lambda pattern that responds to Control Tower lifecycle events:

{panel:title=Architecture Flow|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ccc|titleBGColor=#f7f7f7|bgColor=#ffffff}
Control Tower Lifecycle Events → Producer Lambda (Event Handler) → SQS Queue (Message Buffer) → Consumer Lambda (Config Updater) → Target Account Config Recorder
{panel}

h3. Component Details

# *Producer Lambda Function*
#* Monitors Control Tower lifecycle events via EventBridge
#* Triggers on: Account creation, Account updates, Landing Zone updates
#* Filters excluded accounts (Management, Log Archive, Audit)
#* Sends account information to SQS queue for processing

# *Consumer Lambda Function*
#* Processes messages from SQS queue
#* Assumes AWSControlTowerExecution role in target accounts
#* Updates Config recorder settings to exclude specified resource types
#* Applies daily recording frequency for specific resource types

# *SQS Queue*
#* Provides reliable message delivery between Lambda functions
#* Enables retry logic and error handling
#* Decouples event processing from Config updates

AWS_PROFILE=org-admin python3 verify.py
{code}

h2. Verification Procedures

h3. Automated Verification

The {{verify.py}} script performs the following checks:

# *CloudFormation Stack Status*
#* Confirms stack is in COMPLETE state
#* Verifies stack parameters include EC2 Fleet exclusions
#* Shows last update timestamp

# *Lambda Function Status*
#* Checks Producer and Consumer Lambda deployment
#* Reviews recent execution logs
#* Confirms EventBridge rule configuration

# *Config Recorder Settings* (if TARGET_ACCOUNT specified)
#* Assumes role in target account
#* Retrieves Config recorder configuration
#* Confirms exclusion list contains EC2 Fleet resources

h3. Manual Verification

{tabs}
{tab:title=AWS Console}
# Navigate to AWS Config in any managed account
# Click "Settings" in the left navigation menu
# Select the "Recording" tab
# Verify the exclusion list contains:
#* AWS::EC2::EC2Fleet
#* AWS::EC2::SpotFleet
{tab}
{tab:title=AWS CLI}
{code:bash}
# Assume role in managed account
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/AWSControlTowerExecution \
  --role-session-name ConfigCheck

# Check Config recorder settings
aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders \
  --region us-east-2 \

h2. Troubleshooting Guide

h3. Common Issues and Resolutions

{warning:title=Important Notes}
* Deploy from Management Account: This solution must be deployed from your AWS Control Tower management account (891377069955)
* Region: Deploy in your Control Tower home region (us-east-2)
* AWS Profile: Use the org-admin profile for authentication
* Propagation Time: Changes may take 5-10 minutes to propagate to all managed accounts
* Existing Resources: This only affects future Config recording. Existing Config data is not deleted
{warning}

{expand:title=Issue: Deployment Fails with "No updates are to be performed"}
*Cause*: Stack is already up-to-date with no changes
*Resolution*: This is expected behavior. The stack is already deployed correctly.
{expand}

{expand:title=Issue: Consumer Lambda Fails with Access Denied}
*Cause*: AWSControlTowerExecution role missing in target account
*Resolution*:
* Verify account is enrolled in Control Tower
* Check Control Tower dashboard for enrollment status
* Re-enroll account if necessary
{expand}

{expand:title=Issue: Config Recorder Not Updated After Deployment}
*Cause*: Processing delay or Lambda execution failure
*Resolution*:
* Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
* Check Lambda logs for errors
* Manually trigger update by updating stack with new timestamp
{expand}

{expand:title=Issue: Stack Creation Fails with IAM Error}
*Cause*: Insufficient permissions in deployment account
*Resolution*:
* Verify using Control Tower management account
* Ensure AWS profile has AdministratorAccess
* Check AWS Organizations SCPs for restrictions
{expand}

h3. Debug Commands

{code:bash}
# Check SQS queue for pending messages
aws sqs get-queue-attributes \
  --queue-url [QueueURL] \
  --attribute-names ApproximateNumberOfMessages \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --profile org-admin

# View recent Control Tower events
aws events list-rules \

{code}

h2. Rollback Procedures

h3. Option 1: Complete Stack Deletion (Recommended)

Remove the solution and restore Control Tower defaults:

{code:bash}
aws cloudformation delete-stack \
  --stack-name ControlTowerConfigCustomization \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --profile org-admin

# Monitor deletion
aws cloudformation wait stack-delete-complete \
  --stack-name ControlTowerConfigCustomization \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --profile org-admin
{code}

h3. Option 2: Modify Exclusion List

Update the stack to remove specific exclusions:

# Edit {{template.yaml}}
# Modify the {{ConfigRecorderExcludedResourceTypes}} parameter default value
# Remove "AWS::EC2::EC2Fleet,AWS::EC2::SpotFleet" from the list
# Redeploy: {{AWS_PROFILE=org-admin python3 deploy.py}}

h3. Post-Rollback Verification

After rollback, verify Config recorders have reverted:
{code:bash}
# Check a managed account
aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --query 'ConfigurationRecorders[0].recordingGroup'
{code}
